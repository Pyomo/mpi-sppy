Examples
========

If you installed directly from github, the top
level directory  ``examples`` 
contains some sub-directories with examples.

If you did not get the code from github (e.g., if
you installed with pip), you will need to
get the examples from:
https://github.com/Pyomo/mpi-sppy/tree/master/examples
