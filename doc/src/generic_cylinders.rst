.. _generic_cylinders:

`generic_cylinders.py`
======================

The program ``mpisppy.generic_cylinders.py`` provides a starting point for
creating a customized program for processing a model or perhaps it will be all
that is needed for a particular model. Not all mpi-sppy features
are implemented in this program, but enough are to provide examples and to get
started. A bash script to illustrate its use is ``examples.generic_cylinders.bash``.

For a new model, you will need to create a python file that will
be refered to as the ``module`` and/or the ``model file``.
The file must contain a :ref:`scenario_creator` and :ref:`helper_functions`.
The file name is given without the the ``.py`` extension as the
``--module-name`` on the command and it should be the first argument. It is
needed even with the ``--help`` argument, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash
   
    python ../mpisppy/generic_cylinders.py --module-name farmer/farmer --help

.. Note::
   If you want to run cylinders, you need to use ``mpiexec``; however, if you are
   solving the EF directly, you do not need ``mpiexec``.


.. Note::
    This functionality is at the level of alpha-release.
