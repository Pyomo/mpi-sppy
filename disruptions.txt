(Summer 2022) Conversion to Pyomo config will cause disruption for many users.

See examples such as xxxxx (farmer is OK, too, but it is slightly complicated by
the use of a positional argument on the command line).

0. baseparsers should be replaced by config
1. vanilla should be replaced by vanilla_cfg
2. Command line arguments using "with" have had the "with_" removed
   and the default is now False!

Send an email to DLWoodruff@UCDavis.edu if you want help converting.

Release yyyy was done right before this change.
