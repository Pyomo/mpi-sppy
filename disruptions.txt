(Summer 2022) Conversion to Pyomo config will cause disruption for many users.

See examples such as netdes (farmer is OK, too, but it is slightly complicated by
the use of a positional argument on the command line).

0. baseparsers should be replaced by config

1. vanilla should be replaced by vanilla_cfg

2. Command line arguments using "with" have had the "with_" removed
   and the default is now False! (So you need, e.g. --xhatshuffle and --lagrangian)
   There are no longer no_ options in config.py

3. If you are using vanilla, the first element of beans should be cfg rather than args, where
    cfg = config.global_config

4. For multi-stage problems using --branching-factors on the command line, the
   branching factor list needs to be in quotes.

5. zhat4xhat (and some other confidence interval code) needs --xhatpath on the command
   line before the name of the npy file.

Send an email to DLWoodruff@UCDavis.edu if you want help converting.

BTW: a release was done right before this change.
