# In this file, we create a (linear) inter-region minimal cost distribution problem.
# Our data, gives the constraints inside each in region in region_dict_creator
# and amongst the different regions in inter_region_dict_creator
# The data slightly differs depending on the number of regions (num_scens) which is created for 2, 3 or 4 regions

# Note: regions in our model will be represented in mpi-sppy by scenarios and to ensure the inter-region constraints
#       we will use dummy-nodes, which will be represented in mpi-sppy by non-anticipative variables
#       The following association of terms are made: regions = scenarios, and dummy-nodes = nonants = consensus-vars
