""" Conventional wisdom seems to be that we should use Put calls locally (i.e.
    a process should Put() into its own buffer), and Get calls for
    communication (i.e. call Get on a remote target, rather than your local
    buffer). The following implementation uses this paradigm.

    The communication in this paradigm is a star graph, with the hub at the
    center and the spokes on the outside. Each spoke is concerned only
    with the hub, but the hub must track information about all of the
    spokes.

    Separate hub and spoke classes for memory/window management?
